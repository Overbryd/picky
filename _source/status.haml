    %h3 Status
    %p
      We have released 2.7! The API is now much sexier :)
    %p
      We are working on a 3.0 release towards making Picky the most flexible search server available. Motto: "It's all Ruby – do whatever you like!"
    %p
      Quite a few more features are planned.
    %p
      See the
      %a{ :href => 'http://github.com/floere/picky/wiki/Roadmap' } Roadmap
      and
      %a{ :href => 'http://github.com/floere/picky/issues' } Issues
      to see what's – probably – going to happen next.
    %h3 Specs
    %p
      Server: Around 1000 specs, 70 of them complete integration specs.
      Other gems: Around 150 specs.
    %p
      The 1000 server specs run in ~4 seconds.
